# ros2_robot_car_follower_gazebo
A follower robotcar that is built from scratch, including the follower algorithm, URDF, and controller set up. It is simulated in Gazebo, and using ROS2 as the controller.

After spawning it in Gazebo, and launch the gazebo launching file, and insert an obstacle infront of the car, it starts working!

I build it from scratch instead of using ros2/gazebo tutorial plugin (that already done everything for you) just for learning purpose.
